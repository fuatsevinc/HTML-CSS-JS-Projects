  The Full Stack Web Development program we offer can lead any beginner 
  through the process, or take intermediate to advanced-level professionals
  to the next level in their careers! The learning path starts with IT 
  Framework for beginners and continues with Front-end and Back-end 
  developer course modules.

<p>A full-stack web developer is a programmer who has the basic 
  knowledge for all layers of an application. Each layer is 
  called a “stack”. Full stack web developers have the ability 
  to design complete web applications and websites which requires
  both front-end and back-end skills. They work on the 
  database and debugging of web applications or websites.
